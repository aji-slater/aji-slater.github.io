<!-- REFLECTION

-How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I've never done something like that before. All of my web design in the past has been solitary. It was very helpful to have someone else throwing ideas into the mix, and I think we came to a better product than either of us would have arrived at without pairing. We could double check each other and make sure we weren't leaving any simple oversights in our code. Very helpful.
-Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Absolutely. Keeping something in your head and trying to make it happen directly in code is just too complicated. You're too likely to just flat out miss something, forget something, or not realize that elements just won't work together the way you thought.
-What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We were mostly concerned with legibility. The thought was that if we had to come back to the wireframe later, and we weren't going to be able to decipher what we meant with the diagrams, then it was useless. So we focused on simplicity and clarity.
-What new semantic elements did you learn about?
I pulled up a page with a list of semantic formatting elements, and we used those sections in our html. We used main, header, footer, section and article.-->
