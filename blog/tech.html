      Programming languages can, as most things, be broken into two categorizations, statically typed and dynamically typed. This isn't to say that this is the most fundamental level of distinction between programming languages, however. Just as strawberries and tomatoes can both be classified together as red, they can be classified separately as berry and fruit. So when discussing type in programming, we can distinguish by the two camps of dynamic and static.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic thought behind type systems is to set up a set of definitions around how parts of the program interact with each other, and therefore reduce potential bugs. Checking the program against these definitions can either happen statically, meaning at compile time, or dynamically, at run time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type checking boils down to each piece of information being assigned a type or category, and making sure that the processes they are asked to complete by the code is a process that makes sense for that kind of information to complete. The type system will determine when and what kind of errors are thrown by typing missteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      What this means at the most visible level is whether a programmer is required to initialize and specify the type of a unit of information before it is used, or whether it can be initialized when first used, and it's type inferred by context.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, sides have been chosen, and lines in the sand drawn over these two ideas. Proponents of static typing say that dynamic typing leaves too much space open for potential bugs and problems down the line. If the type errors were caught at compile time, it would save a lot of headaches, as it's always better to catch bugs sooner rather than later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a situation where a programmer coding in a dynamic language calls for a variable named "dynamic" in one section of the program, but misspells the variable name further down the line. The misspelled variable, "dymanic" would be created, and part of the process would use it instead of the intended variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followers of the Dynamic Typing banner consider that 'weakness' a strength. Being able to use and create a cariable whenever you want can be a powerful tool, and can save many extra lines of code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, the debate is mostly useless, full of sound and fury signifying nothing. (I knew those years studying Shakespeare would finally pay off!) Each side has strengths and weaknesses, and those differences can be used and weilded as tools. Rather than scrapping one completely for the other, many developers seek "Static typing where possible, dynamic typing when needed," a phrase written by Erik Meijer and Peter Drayton in a paper of the same name. As with most everything in life, absolutes are unecessary, and more power is gained through flexibility and understanding of both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      So type statically.. type dynamically! Just know what you need and Get To It!
