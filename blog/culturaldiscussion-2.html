    <p>
      There is one issue above many others that has bothered me as I look at joining the worldwide Ruby community. It's something that is a plague upon the entire tech industry, but seems magnified amongst Rubyists for some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rampant, Unabashed Misogyny.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know the tech world is mostly populated with men. That's product of a society that shames young women who are interested in math and science and tech into giving up those pursuits to chase after a pre-approved set of careers. That's a product of a culture egged on by testosterone that creates work environments that are so hostile to women, they wouldn't want to join anyway. That's a product of a system that thinks so nearsightedly much of itself that the way it is is obviously how it's supposed to be that it hires and promotes men over women at an alarming rate. Don't even get me started on how trans* women are treated in the tech world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no doubt that the majority of shops in the tech world are not guilty of this, and when they are guilty of it they work hard to correct for their accidental mistakes and foibles. I refuse to believe that people as a whole want to be awful to other humans. Yet there are enough of the bad ones out there to make it an unavoidable problem for the vast majority of women in today's tech industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for some reason... the Ruby community stands out. Doesn't stand out for striving against an almost institutionalized disregard for equality and respect, but stands out as the shining example of how not to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short blog written by <a href="http://devandpencil.herokuapp.com/about">Elad Meidar</a> entitled <a href="http://devandpencil.herokuapp.com/blog/2013/10/09/being-an-asshole-does-not-make-you-awesome">"Being an asshole does not make you awesome"</a> takes a very brief look into this culture of disrespect Ruby has somehow inadvertently fostered. In a test with a similar laughably low bar as the Bechdel Test, Elad did a quick search of popular gems on the site rubygems.org, and these are the names of a few he found.
    </p>
    <code>
      <ul>
<li>bitch</li>
<li>hoe</li>
<li>womanizer</li>
<li>recursive_pimp_slap</li>
<li>miniskirt</li>
<li>childlabor</li>
<li>bj</li>
<li>sex</li>
<li>fuck</li>
and
<li>rape-me</li>
</ul>
</code>
<p>
  Cute.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similar searches through similar repositories for other programming languages yielded no such results. Elad noted that some of those gems have over 20k downloads, so certainly they're not sitting in some dusty corner and never being used or talked about.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe other communities just have restrictions on naming their shared code in such an obviously hurtful and malicious manner. Then what does that say about Ruby that they don't make that a priority, or even an item at all?
  </p>
  <p>
    And who can forget the famous talk by Matt Almonetti called "CouchDB and Ruby - Perform like a Porn Star"? I'll leave you to guess at the kind of imagery that was going to be on his slides.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what can we do? The first step is simple. Be better. You don't have to don a suit of armor and charge into the fight if you don't want to. Just be better. If you're feeling up to it, and you have a small opportunity, speak up. It's like at the airport, if you see something, say something. Especially if you're coming from the place of white male privilege. And remember, being an asshole does not make you awesome.
