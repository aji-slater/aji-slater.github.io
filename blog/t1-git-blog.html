  <h1>Bootcamp Begins Bremotely</h1>
  <h2>Or: Alliteration's great, isn't it?</h2>

      :> Hello and welcome fellow beginning coder! I will not presume to say that I have a great deal more knowledge or experience than anyone else who is just starting out, what I can describe is what I've learned along my trip through learning to become a web developer. Through Dev Bootcamp, I have the opportunity to learn from those who have been there before who have dedicated their focus and time to imparting their skills to up-and-coming programmers. If reading any more about my experiences in this coursework should help someone else on their path, than I am happy to have helped. Lets get started, shall we?
    <p>
      :> In the beginning, there was the command line, and it was good. Users interacted with the machines and began to create projects together. Soon these pioneers of programming needed a system with which to collaborate, and control the versions of their changes and updates to their communal code. In 2005, Linus Torvalds introduced Git, a distributed change management system which quickly became one of the most widely used such system. This, combined with the online portal GitHub, is the system we have been experimenting with and learning in this remote week 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      :> A systematized process for version control is invaluable to any team. Updates and changes can be unwieldy and haphazard without measures in place to normalize integration of the work between parties on the project. Version control also allows for tracking progress as projects develop and puts in place the ability to revert to earlier changes should the need arise.
    </p>
    <p>:> Git is a piece of software that tracks each change to a set of files related to a project or discrete piece of work. Whether that is an amount of code, reports or other documents, git will help to manage each iteration as it is updated. Git also allows for separate "branches" to be created, allowing for editing and testing without disturbing the pristine master copy that holds all approved and current decisions. Separate branches make experimentation less of a risk, and can therefore lead to larger gains than can be had when team members have to worry about disturbing a single shared copy of the project. Once ready, these branches are merged into the master document which all users draw from. This way, everyone can be sure that they are utilizing the most up to date version of the project.
    </p>
    <p>:> Github is an online hosting service for users of git. Github utilizes the command line functionality of Git and overlays a web or desktop based graphical user interface, as well as some features unique to its platform. Users store a shared version of the project they are working in on the Github servers, and thereby take advantage of remote interfacing. Multiple users can access the same master document without sharing a terminal, or physically passing around a hard copy of their code. This ensures that each individual user has the most up-to-date version of the project, and that everyone regardless of time or space can be completely caught up on the salient changes to their work.
    </p>
    <p>:> This exploration of the command line and Git has been a new experience for me, but rewarding because it has pushed me outside of my comfortable knowledge base, and opened my perception to a part of our world and culture I had no contact with before. I hope you dear reader, will stay with me as I continue along this exciting path of 1s and 0s, and that my mistakes and observations can aid you in your own exploration of computers, the internet, and the code that binds us all.
