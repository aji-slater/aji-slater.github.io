      Maybe we got a little complacent with Ruby. Maybe we were introduced to a language that is so user friendly and included so many built-in straightforward methods so we could not have to worry about it at first and just learn how to talk to a computer. Maybe javascript will be an interesting challenge. Not as user-friendly as Ruby, but at the same time more accommodating (which in the end lends more to its difficulty).
    </p>
    <p>
      There aren't as many baked-in methods with javascript as there are in Ruby. A lot of what we've been doing with js has required us to make some functions from the ground up; things that would have been included in Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that there are going to be times when we'll need to include a certain function, and eventually we'll be using other people's code so we don't have to reinvent the wheel and re-do everything all the time. Right now however, we're building it ourselves so that we have a better understanding of the fundamental principals at work. I for one, am all for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take a look at one little difference between Ruby and js, namely, iterating over an array. How would we do this in Ruby?
    </p>
    <code>.each</code>
    <p>
      Boom! Done! It's built in, it's simple, it's one word! What about js?
    </p>
    <code>
      for ( i=0; i <= array.length; i++) {<br>
      <span class="indent">array[i]</span><br>
    }
    </code>
    <p>
      Woah woah woah, I'm sorry, what? What's going on there, you might ask. It's really the same thing that Array#each can do in Ruby, it's just showing a few more of its steps in the code. This kind of iteration is such a common thing in coding, that the for loop is built in, which offers the ability to iterate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In js, it's just asking you to outline exactly how to iterate over your object more specifically. This can add another layer of complexity or another wrinkle to your code, but in the end, it makes a for loop more powerful than Array#each. Sure, Ruby can do the things that js can do with it's for loops, but with everything laid bare in your code.. js makes it real easy to reach in and muck about with it.
