      With CSS, a designer will style the elements in their html code with a cascading style sheet. Both classes and ids are used within that document to identify what elements in the html should be applied from the style sheet. But which is better? When should you use one and not the other?
    </p>
    <p>
      General best practice rule of thumb...just don't use ids. Done. Article over.
    </p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>
      Ids narrow the modification that can be performed to one specific element. Unlike classes, ids cannot be shared across your page. Doesn't that sound a little like inline styling? And what do we think about inline styling? That's right. Don't do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes are much more flexible. Do you think there's going to be more than one element that might use that styling preference on your page? If the answer to that question has even the slightest chance of being "maybe," just use a class. Sure, you might not need it now, but it's going to be harder to switch when you decide to use it.
    </p>
    <div class="fnt-courier txt-grn bg-drk p-sm marg-l-m marg-r-m p-lt-m">
      #styling a {color: red}</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Besides just leaving your code messy and illegible, ids are very inefficient. Consider that your browser is going to read each line of code from right to left. In the code above, rather than looking first for an id called "styling," then finding the a tags with that id before applying whatever instructions it has; which is opposed by the quick and efficient class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole point of using CSS instead of styling right in the html is to be flexible, and to be able to apply those styles and adjustments across not only one page, but many pages. Id tags limit that strength, by going in the opposite direction.
    </p>
     <div class="fnt-courier txt-grn bg-drk p-sm marg-l-m marg-r-m p-lt-m">
      .p-l-m { padding-left: 1em; } </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Need that div to have some left padding? BAM! .p-l-m. Need that article tag to have a little space on the left? BAM! .p-l-m. Can your id do that? I don't think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But don't start to think that I'm completely against using CSS ids. They're just not meant for styling. Save those ids for calling specific elements with your code, be that javascript or what have you. Use your tools to their strengths, and don't try to shoehorn one into the wrong fitting just because you only know one way to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now go out there, and get best practicin'.
