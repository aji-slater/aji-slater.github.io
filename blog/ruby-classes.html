      Class. That's a common identifier in programming, there are clases in CSS, there are classes in C++, and there are classes in Ruby. Ruby classes are similar to C++ classes, but very different from those in CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruby classes are a definition of a type of object in the Ruby environment. Classes will define what methods the object canrun, and can define how the objects will hold class and instance variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this all seems a little out of left field, you already know classes. An Array is a class, a Hash is a class, a String is a class. Ruby allows you to create your own classes and the methods within, just like .reverse is a method in the String class, you could make .the_best a method in the IAm class...or something like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      See that above? That little snip of code? That's a cute way of starting the post and letting you know we're going to be talking about classes, and it's also the syntax for starting a new class. It's just that easy. Just type...
    </p>
    <center><code>
      class YourClassName<br><br>end
    </code></center>
    <p>
      It's standard Ruby practice to write classes in CamelCase. We're going to write in the "end" to the class as soon as we start writing it. That's a good habit to get into, if what you just put down needs an end, write it right away, don't wait and risk maybe forgetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In between the class and end is where all the class magic happens. This is where you can define class methods and variables. Let's take a look at some more code.
    </p>
    <center><code>
      class YourClassName<br><br>
      <span class="indent">def initialize(greeting)<br></span>
      <span class="indent_twice">@greeting = greeting<br></span>
      <span class="indent">end<br><br></span>
      end
    </code></center>
    <p>
      This first method we are defining is going to be called when a new instance of the class is created in your code. We've required an argument here, so there's going to be an argument passed when the instance is created as well. Just like creating a new array and immediately putting some data into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second line of that method installs the argument into a variable called greeting. What's that "@" before the variable name? That tells Ruby that you want that to be an instance variable. An instance variable will be held with each instance, or copy, of the object and can be read by any method in that class. Let's take a look at this in action.
    </p>
    <center><code>
      class YourClassName<br><br>
      <span class="indent">def initialize(user_name)<br></span>
      <span class="indent_twice">@name = user_name<br></span>
      <span class="indent">end<br><br></span>
      <span class="indent">def hello_world<br></span>
      <span class="indent_twice"puts "Greetings, #{@name}!"<br></span>
      <span class="indent">end<br><br></span>
      end
    </code></center>
    <p>
      See that? Right there! Without the class, that variable would have to be passed through arguments, and couldn't just call it back up in another method. But that instance variable is going to be held in the single copy of the YourClassName object. So when you run the method on that object, it already knows the @name variable, because it was assigned in the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this little touch on the surface of classes and instance variables has piqued your interest and begun to show you just how important classes can be.
