<!-- MAIN CODE HERE -->

<p>
Aji had a roundabout way to a career in coding and development. Out of high school and into studying art at Wayne StateUniversity in Detroit, he came close to making a living with ones and zeroes as he studied graphic design. But the call of sculpture and paint was too strong, and he spent his time creating with traditional media. Still, those projects never failed to be tinted with electronic and interactive media.
</p>
<p>
Falling into a crowd of performers in the Motor City, Aji took to vaudeville and performing like a fish to water. In 2005, he moved out to San Francisco to study circus arts at the world famous San Francisco Circus Center. Deep in Silicon Valley, Aji brushed up against his future again, this time juggling for tech companies, and constantly re-doing his performance website.
</p>
<p>
After a tour with Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, and two international tours of self-produced and created shows, Aji took to the snow with a move to Chicago. It was here he realized that the whole time as a performer, the most interesting part of the work was building the websites and the graphic design of the internet. Retiring from performing, Aji set out to update his skills and dive headfirst into the development world.

Having devoted so much of his life to performance and comedy, Aji brings a unique insight to how users interact with media.
