# Welcome-to-Carver-House
+Procedurally generated exploration game, lovecraftian setting and themes.
 
-Evelyn Carver, recently deceased...spent her final years keeping her stately Manor home under constant construction. Secret passages, stairways to nowhere, and other architectural curiosities. No one knows her true intention, some say it was to attract the spirits of the dead, so she may once again be with her dearly departed husband. The widow has no heirs, so ownership of the mansion and it's considerable portrait collection has fallen to the bank. The house is chained and avoided by anyone with any sense. Rumors of schoolboys exploring too far and disappearing.. rumors of new portaits joining the collection.. rumors of the house groaning and creeking throughout the night as though it were changing, as though it is alive.

Sent by the bank to appraise the property, midday turns to dusk and then to night on Ivy Cole's approach to the house. Time shifts underneath her feet, and the reason why a junior member of her office was sent for such a palacial estate becomes clear.

Inside, Ivy is met with an impossibly vast chamber and series of hallways and rooms. Behind her, with a barely perceptible click, the door to the world she knows vanishes even as she whirled to grab it. Ivy never believed in ghosts...but she may just be persuaded before the night is over. Welcome to Carver House.
 
-Welcome to Carver House is a procedurally generated exploration game. That means the sounds, the music, the house...and it's inhabitants, are built by algorithm, making it **literally infinite**. Built on html5's canvas, Phaser, and pixi javascript libraries, comes a game in which a player will explore the house gathering items and experiences while trying to leave it's labyrinthian hallways. The intrepid investigator will eventually come face to face with Evelyn Carver, an encounter which triggers a story shift generated in relation to the player's experiences exploring the house so far. Only then shall the exit become accessible.
