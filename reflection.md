--What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

The more I work with the positioning attributes, the more comfortable I get using them. Now that we are working a little bit with the design of the site, we're getting the opportunity to see how those can really impact the way the site looks.

--What did you learn about CSS positioning?

Positioning can be finicky. The best tool so far to work with that I've found is the Chrome DevTools. By using the highlighting feature of the devtools, you can check out where exactly a positioning error might be, as well as temporarily adjusting any property that could be affecting it and seeing the result right away without having to go back to the code.

--What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Implementing the avatars in the top header was far easier than I thought it would be. It was only one line in the css file. Normally I would've made a circular picture in Photoshop, and had to either change the background in the jpeg every time I modified the header, or used a gif, which would have far worse image fidelity.

--What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I stuck very closely to an atomic structure with my css. That's a new approach for me, and it's been working out very well. It's very easy to keep track of what is going on in my code with a glance, and keeps the css file trim and tidy.
This does, I will admit, start to make the html rather crowded pretty quickly. I wonder if there is a convention that addresses this. Investigation is required, certainly.
